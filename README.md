<em>I am a 4th Year undergraduate student from <a href="http://www.git.edu/"><b>KLS Gogte Institute of Technology</b></a>. From very early on in my life, I started to fall in love with technology 😍 This love has helped me develop a very good technological mindset <img src="https://github.com/rajput2107/rajput2107/blob/master/Assets/PC.gif" height="20px"/>, and given me the curiosity to learn more. I firmly believe that **no amount of knowledge <img src="https://github.com/rajput2107/rajput2107/blob/master/Assets/Rocket.gif" height="18px"> is enough knowledge**. 🧠</em>
